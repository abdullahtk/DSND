# Project Description

The purpose of the project is to analyze Airbnb data related to listings in Los Angeles city and answer three business questions. The questions are:
* Can I predict the price of a home/room that arenâ€™t yet in the market?
* What are the most important factors in determining the price?
* Which days are the busiest?

## Folders and Files
The folder 'data' contains the two compressed files, due to size limitation:
* calendar 2.csv.zip: which contains the listings with dates of availability
* listings 2.csv.zip: which contains the listings with features

The folder 'source' contains jupyter notebook and the html version of the notebook.
