\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Project Description\
\
The purpose of the project is to analyze Airbnb data related to listings in Los Angeles city and answer three business questions. The questions are:\
* Can I predict the price of a home/room that aren\'92t yet in the market?\
* What are the most important factors in determining the price?\
* Which days are the busiest?\
\
## Folders and Files\
The folder 'data' contains the two compressed files, due to size limitation:\
* calendar 2.csv.zip: which contains the listings with dates of availability\
* listings 2.csv.zip: which contains the listings with features\
\
The folder 'source' contains jupyter notebook and the html version of the notebook.\
